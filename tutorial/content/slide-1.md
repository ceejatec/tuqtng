## Welcome!

This tutorial walks you through the basics of using the Couchbase Query Language.

On the right hand side you see a query editor. All of the queries in this tutorial will be against a bucket named "tutorial".  There are also a few other buckets that have been populated:

* contacts
* blog
* game
* products
* orders
* tags
* non-json

Go ahead, run your first query now!

<pre id="example">
SELECT 'Hello World' AS Greeting
</pre>
