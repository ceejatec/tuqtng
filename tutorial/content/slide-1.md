## Section 1. N1QL Basics
Welcome!

N1QL ("nickel") is the query language from Couchbase. 
N1QL aims to meet the query needs of distributed document-oriented databases. This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the SELECT statement in N1QL.

N1QL stands for Non-1st Query Language. The name reflects the fact that the Couchbase document-oriented data model is based on Non-1st Normal Form (N1NF).

On the right hand side you see a query editor.

SELECT 'Hello World' AS Greeting
