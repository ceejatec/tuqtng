## <b>Section 1. N1QL Basics</b>
Welcome to the Couchbase N1QL tutorial!

N1QL (pronounced as “nickel”) is Couchbase’s next generation query language. N1QL aims to meet the query needs of distributed document-oriented databases. This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the SELECT statement in N1QL.

The N1QL data model derives its name from the non-first normal form, which is a superset and generalization of the relational first normal form (1NF). 

On the right hand side you see a query editor.
